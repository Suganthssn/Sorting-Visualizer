Bubble Sort Visualizer

A simple web-based Bubble Sort Visualizer built using JavaScript async functions to animate the sorting process. This project helps beginners understand how the Bubble Sort algorithm works step-by-step through visual representation.

🚀 Features

Visual bars representing array elements

Bubble Sort animation using async/await

Adjustable sorting speed

Random array generation

Color changes during comparisons and swaps

Beginner-friendly UI

🧠 Algorithm Used
Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the array is sorted.

Time Complexity

Best Case: O(n)

Average Case: O(n²)

Worst Case: O(n²)

Space Complexity

O(1)
